# Coffee Machine

This is a simple Python program that simulates a coffee machine. It allows users to perform actions like buying coffee, adding ingredients, taking money, and checking the remaining resources.

## Features

The coffee machine program offers the following features:

- Buying coffee: Users can choose from three types of coffee (espresso, latte, and cappuccino) and purchase them. The program checks if there are enough resources (water, milk, coffee beans) available to make the selected coffee.

- Filling the machine: Users can add more water, milk, coffee beans, and disposable cups to the machine.

- Taking money: Users can collect all the money accumulated in the machine.

- Displaying the remaining resources: Users can check the current status of the coffee machine, including the amount of water, milk, coffee beans, disposable cups, and money.

## Getting Started

To run the coffee machine program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.6 or higher).

2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code files.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

4. Run the following command to start the coffee machine program:

   ```bash
   python coffee_machine.py
   ```

5. You will be prompted to enter actions such as buying, filling, taking, checking remaining resources, or exiting the program. Simply follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the coffee machine.

## Usage

1. When prompted, enter one of the following actions: `buy`, `fill`, `take`, `remaining`, or `exit`.

2. If you choose to buy coffee, you will be asked to select the type of coffee (espresso, latte, or cappuccino). The program will check the availability of resources and deduct them from the machine if sufficient resources are available. The cost of the coffee will be added to the machine's money.

3. If you choose to fill the machine, you will be prompted to enter the amount of water, milk, coffee beans, and disposable cups to add to the machine. These quantities will be added to the existing resources.

4. If you choose to take money, the program will display the amount of money available in the machine and reset it to zero.

5. If you choose to check the remaining resources, the program will display the current status of the coffee machine, including the amount of water, milk, coffee beans, disposable cups, and money.

6. You can continue performing actions until you choose to exit the program.
